/*
In mathematics, a base is the number of different digits or combinations of digits and letters 
that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. 
For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system because "dec" means 1, 
it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. A decimal number has base 10, a binary has base 2, an octal has base 8,etc.
Given a non-negative interger & a base as input, create a program to convert the given decimal into the corresponding base.
